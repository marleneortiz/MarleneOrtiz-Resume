        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Marlene Ortiz Rios and I am a freshman at The University of California, Riverside. My major is currently Political Science/ Public Service and I am a member of the C.H.A.S.S. college. I hope to pursue law school after I earn my bachelor's degree. I am proud to say I am a first generation student as well as the first of my siblings to attend a four year institution. The University of California, Riverside was the school I was hoping of getting into and when I receive my admissions acceptance, it was one of the highlights of the year. Not only did i get accepted, but I also later on got the news that I won two scholarships. Those scholarships made it possible for me to come debt free to school for my first year which happens to be the most expensive one.<br><br>

        Some facts about myself, is that my favorite color is pink and I do not really have a favorite animal but if I had to choose I guess it would be any animal in its baby state. If I have to choose a favorite hobby, it definitely is traveling. It is a passion my best friend Yesenia opened my eyes too. We both dream and always talk about our future adventures together. My first trip was to Costa Rica in the summer of 2019. I cannot wait to pursue many more adventures with the people I love. Since traveling is such an important factor of my future life goals, studying abroad is definitely something I am looking forward to doing. My favorite food is definitely Italian with pasta being the main dish of preference. I speak both English and Spanish and I have to admit I favor Spanish much much. As a result, I listen to much more music in Spanish than English but, overall I do not mind listening to most genres of music.<br><br>

        So far, my experience in the University of California, Riverside has been very wonderful if you disregard all the stress that comes along with all the courses. One of my goals for my upcoming sophomore year is definitely to become more active and involved in my community. I am for sure going to look into joining clubs as well as participating in volunteer work. I surprisingly love to volunteer because it just brings satisfaction and also helps me develop leadership skills. One of the programs I have participated in that I am the most proud of has to be after school tutoring for immigration students. My high school is very large in both size and number of students, therefore we have a lot of students from around the world. Most, who speak no or very little english. In their time of adapting the language, they struggled doing their assignments and homework, so they looked for help. The program was hosted by my speech and debate teacher and I was very interested in participating. The program touches close to home because I myself am an English learner.
